    </figure>
    
    <h3>The Prehistory: Hot Rods and Customs (1930s-1950s)</h3>
    
    <p>The intellectual lineage of the restomod can be traced to America's early hot rod culture. Born from economic necessity and youthful ingenuity during the Great Depression, hot rodders modified affordable Ford Model Ts and Model As for improved performance, creating what automotive historian Robert Genat describes as "the first democratization of performance."</p>
    
    <p>Key developments during this proto-restomod era included:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Mechanical Hybridization</strong> - Enthusiasts began combining components from different vehicles for performance gains</li>
      <li><strong>Speed Equipment Industry</strong> - The birth of aftermarket parts companies like Edelbrock, Offenhauser, and Iskenderian</li>
      <li><strong>Custom Car Movement</strong> - Led by pioneers like George Barris and Ed Roth, focused on aesthetic modifications</li>
      <li><strong>Hot Rod Publications</strong> - Magazines that spread technical knowledge and aesthetic trends nationally</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>While these early modified vehicles emphasized performance over preservation, they established the core principle that would later define restomods: that automobiles could be simultaneously honored and improved through thoughtful modification.</p>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p>"The hot rodders of the 1940s and customizers of the 1950s weren't trying to preserve history—they were creating something new from something old because that's what they could afford. But they inadvertently created the foundational techniques that restomods would later build upon with more sophisticated goals."</p>
      <cite>— Pat Ganahl, Hot Rod Historian</cite>
    </blockquote>
    
    <h3>The Rise of Preservation: Concours Culture (1960s-1970s)</h3>
    
    <p>As classic cars began to be recognized as historically significant artifacts in the 1960s, a preservation ethos emerged that viewed modifications as degrading to a vehicle's authenticity and value. This period saw:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Growth of Concours d'Elegance Events</strong> - Prestigious shows that rewarded historical accuracy and original condition</li>
      <li><strong>Factory-Correct Restoration Standards</strong> - The development of judging criteria based on historical authenticity</li>
      <li><strong>Rise in Value of Original Vehicles</strong> - The market began rewarding unmodified, historically accurate restorations</li>
      <li><strong>Documentation Emphasis</strong> - Increasing importance placed on historical documentation and provenance</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This preservation movement created a sharp divide in automotive culture between those who modified classics (often viewed as destroying history) and those who preserved them in original condition. This schism would persist for decades, with modified classics generally occupying a lower status and value position in the hierarchy of collector vehicles.</p>
    
    <h3>The Transitional Era: Pro-Touring Emerges (1980s-1990s)</h3>
    
    <p>The intellectual foundations of the modern restomod began to coalesce in the late 1980s and early 1990s with the emergence of the "Pro-Touring" movement, primarily centered around American muscle cars. Key developments included:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Performance Emphasis</strong> - Modifications focused on making classic muscle cars outperform their original specifications</li>
      <li><strong>Modern Suspension Components</strong> - Adaptation of contemporary suspension geometry and components</li>
      <li><strong>Subtle Aesthetic Evolution</strong> - Maintaining the classic appearance with minimal visual modifications</li>
      <li><strong>Track Day Culture</strong> - Emphasis on real-world performance and drivability rather than show-only builds</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Mark Stielow's 1969 Camaro, featured in numerous automotive publications in the early 1990s, is often credited as one of the seminal Pro-Touring builds that helped establish the template for what would eventually be called restomods. These vehicles maintained their classic appearance while incorporating modern drivetrains, brakes, and suspension components for dramatically improved performance.</p>

    <h3>The Terminology Emerges: Restomod is Born (Late 1990s-Early 2000s)</h3>
    
    <p>The term "restomod" itself (a portmanteau of "restoration" and "modified") began appearing in automotive publications around the late 1990s, reflecting the growing recognition that these builds constituted their own category rather than simply being "modified classics." This period saw:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Term Codification</strong> - Widespread adoption of "restomod" in automotive media</li>
      <li><strong>Build Documentation</strong> - Detailed magazine features showcasing the process of creating restomods</li>
      <li><strong>Expanded Vehicle Selection</strong> - The philosophy extending beyond muscle cars to European classics</li>
      <li><strong>Appearance of Specialty Shops</strong> - Businesses dedicated specifically to restomod builds</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Companies like Year One and Classic Instruments began catering specifically to the restomod market, offering components that looked period-correct but delivered modern performance. Television programs featuring vehicle builds helped popularize the concept to a broader audience.</p>
    
    <h3>Technological Evolution and Mainstream Recognition (2000s-2010s)</h3>
    
    <p>The first decade of the 2000s saw restomod building techniques advance significantly through several technical developments:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Crate Engine Programs</strong> - Manufacturer-supported modern engines packaged for installation in classic vehicles</li>
      <li><strong>CAN Bus Integration</strong> - Solutions for integrating modern electronic systems into classic vehicles</li>
      <li><strong>Computer-Aided Design</strong> - Precision-engineered components designed specifically for restomod applications</li>
      <li><strong>Aftermarket Chassis</strong> - Purpose-built frames allowing complete modern suspensions under classic bodies</li>
      <li><strong>OEM Restoration Parts</strong> - Manufacturer support for classic vehicles through parts programs</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>This period also saw major automakers acknowledging the restomod trend. In 2008, General Motors introduced its LS crate engine program specifically targeting classic car owners who wanted modern V8 power. For many observers, this corporate embrace of engine swaps—once considered the domain of hot rodders—marked a turning point in the mainstream acceptance of the restomod philosophy.</p>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p>"When GM started selling LS engines specifically for installation in classic vehicles, it signaled a fundamental shift in how modifications were viewed. Suddenly the factory itself was endorsing the idea that their classics could be improved with modern technology."</p>
      <cite>— Jim Meyer, Automotive Journalist</cite>
    </blockquote>
    
    <h3>The Premium Era: Emergence of High-End Restomods (2010-Present)</h3>
