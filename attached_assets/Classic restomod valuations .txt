An Analytical Review of Market Valuations and Future Projections for Classic Cars and Restomods, with Specific Reference to Saint Joseph, Missouri Collectors
Introduction
The markets for classic cars and their modified counterparts, restomods, represent dynamic and increasingly nuanced segments of the broader automotive landscape. Classic cars, cherished for their historical significance, design, and originality, have long been subjects of collection and investment. More recently, restomods—vehicles that retain classic aesthetics while incorporating modern performance, reliability, and comfort—have garnered significant attention and, in many cases, substantial market value. This report aims to provide an expert-level analysis of the current market values for specific, highly sought-after classic cars and restomods, with a particular focus on makes, models, and production years. Furthermore, it will delve into projections for future market trends, considering demographic shifts, technological advancements, and economic factors relevant to enthusiasts and investors in Saint Joseph, Missouri. The valuation data presented herein is drawn from respected industry resources such as Hagerty Valuation Tools, alongside analysis of recent auction results from prominent houses like Mecum, Barrett-Jackson, RM Sotheby's, and Gooding & Company. The scope encompasses a detailed examination of valuation principles, current market figures for selected vehicles, and a forward-looking perspective on market evolution over the next 5 to 20 years.
Defining "Classic Car" and "Restomod" and Their Valuation Principles
Understanding the precise definitions and core valuation drivers for both classic cars and restomods is fundamental to navigating this complex market. While both categories involve vintage automobiles, the factors determining their worth diverge significantly.
A. Defining a Classic Car for Valuation
The term "classic car" is generally applied to vehicles of a certain age, though definitions vary. Insurance providers like Hagerty often consider cars 25 years or older for classic car policies, with a general cut-off for "classic" status being no older than 40 years, and an emphasis on vehicles being largely unmodified. Mecum Auctions, a leader in collector car sales, deals with vehicles ranging from entry-level classics to investment-grade vintage automobiles, underscoring the breadth of the term.
Beyond age, a vehicle's status as a collectible classic is heavily influenced by several key characteristics:
 * Rarity and Demand: Limited production models or cars with unique features are often more desirable and command higher prices. The interplay of scarcity and enthusiast demand is a primary value driver.
 * Condition and Originality: The physical state of the car is paramount. Concours-quality cars, those in pristine condition with impeccable authenticity, fetch top dollar. Originality, meaning the retention of factory-correct components and specifications, is highly prized. However, the concept of "originality" can be nuanced. For older vehicles, where New Old Stock (NOS) parts are unavailable, the use of period-correct replacement parts may be acceptable, provided these are well-documented and the restoration quality is high. This distinction is critical; deviations from factory specifications, unless part of a meticulously documented, period-correct restoration, can negatively impact value. For collectors in Saint Joseph, this underscores the necessity of thorough pre-purchase inspections and meticulous record-keeping to verify a vehicle's claims of originality and the quality of any restoration work, as these factors directly influence investment potential.
 * Historical Significance: Cars with a notable racing pedigree, association with famous personalities, or significant cultural impact often carry a premium. For instance, models like the Ford Model T or Chevrolet Corvette are valued for their contribution to automotive history.
 * Documentation and Provenance: A comprehensive history, including service records, restoration details, and a clear chain of ownership, enhances a car's value and authenticity.
 * Aesthetics and "Fun Factor": As Jay Leno's rule suggests, a collectible car should possess technical or historical interest and be enjoyable to drive.
B. Defining a Restomod for Valuation
A "restomod" is a classic car that has been restored and modified, blending vintage aesthetics with modern technology and engineering to enhance performance, safety, comfort, and reliability. Coined by Barrett-Jackson in the mid-2000s, the term typically refers to cars that appear mostly stock externally (perhaps with a lowered stance or modern wheels) but feature entirely new underpinnings. Barrett-Jackson further defines Resto-Mods as vehicles restored with modifications, often retaining the spirit of their original form while being performance-focused.
Unlike "hot rods," which often feature overt visual modifications, restomods aim for a more subtle integration of modern components, with much of the "magic" lying beneath the skin. Popular candidates for restomodding include iconic models like Mustangs, Broncos, Camaros, and Corvettes.
The value of a restomod is not primarily dictated by originality, as with classic cars, but rather by the quality and extent of its enhancements. However, this introduces a complex valuation dynamic. A poorly conceived or executed restomod, or one that strays too far into niche personal taste, can be worth less than a comparable stock classic or even the sum of its high-cost parts. There is a delicate balance between desirable, widely accepted upgrades (e.g., modern V8 engine, upgraded brakes, improved suspension) and modifications that might detract from the car's classic essence or limit its resale appeal. For enthusiasts in Saint Joseph considering building or acquiring a restomod, the focus should be on high-quality craftsmanship, reputable components and builders, and modifications that enhance the driving experience while respecting the vehicle's original design integrity.
C. Key Factors Influencing Classic Car Values
The valuation of classic cars is a multifaceted process, hinging on a confluence of intrinsic and extrinsic factors.
 * Rarity and Demand: As previously noted, scarcity is a powerful price inflator. Limited production runs or unique factory options make a car more desirable, especially when coupled with strong market demand for that particular make or model.
 * Condition and Originality: A car’s physical state and adherence to factory specifications are critical. Excellent, original, or meticulously restored-to-original examples command the highest values. The term "matching numbers" (original engine, transmission, etc.) is often a significant value determinant. The nuanced understanding of originality, particularly for very old vehicles where some period-correct, non-NOS parts might be used in a high-quality restoration, is vital. Comprehensive documentation of such restoration work becomes essential for justifying value, a key consideration for Saint Joseph collectors.
 * Historical Significance: Connections to motorsport, famous owners, or pivotal moments in automotive or cultural history can substantially elevate a car's worth.
 * Documentation and Provenance: A verifiable history, including service logs, restoration receipts, and ownership lineage, substantiates authenticity and adds to the car's narrative and value.
 * Market Conditions: Broader economic trends, shifts in collector tastes, and the overall supply and demand dynamics within the classic car market also play a crucial role in determining values.
D. Key Factors Influencing Restomod Values
Restomod valuation departs from the originality-centric model of classic cars, focusing instead on the quality and desirability of the modifications.
 * Quality of Build and Execution: The craftsmanship, attention to detail, and seamless integration of modern systems are paramount. A well-engineered and professionally assembled restomod will always command a premium.
 * Components Used: The choice of engine (e.g., modern LS or Coyote V8s), transmission (e.g., Tremec manuals, modern automatics), suspension systems, brakes, and interior appointments (including technology) significantly impacts value. High-quality, reputable brands are preferred.
 * Builder Reputation: Builds from well-known and respected shops or individuals often carry a higher market value due to their proven track record and the implied quality and reliability.
 * Base Vehicle Choice: The intrinsic desirability, rarity, and initial condition of the classic car used as the foundation for the restomod play a role in its final value.
 * Balance of Classic Aesthetics and Modern Upgrades: The most successful restomods are those that tastefully integrate modern enhancements without compromising the original design's spirit and iconic lines. The goal is to enhance, not erase, the classic identity.
 * Documentation: Detailed records of the build process, including a list of all components used, modifications performed, and associated costs, are crucial for substantiating value and for insurance purposes.
While classic cars prioritize originality, restomods are valued for their thoughtful and high-quality enhancements. However, this path is not without pitfalls. Modifications that are overly personalized, of poor quality, or that detract from the original car's aesthetic appeal can negatively impact value, potentially making the car worth less than an original example or even the cost of the modifications themselves. For enthusiasts in Saint Joseph, this means that investing in a restomod, whether building or buying, requires careful consideration of the modifications' quality, the builder's expertise, and the overall market acceptance of such changes to ensure value retention or appreciation.
E. Understanding Value Types (Market, Replacement, Restoration)
For insurance and appraisal purposes, particularly in the context of classic and collector vehicles, three distinct value types are commonly referenced :
 * Market Value: This represents the current value of the vehicle within the specialized collector vehicle market. It is an average price that would be paid or for which the vehicle would be sold in the private market at the present time. Typically, this value does not include value-added tax or dealer profit margins. For rarely traded vehicles, net amounts from dealer sales and international auction results may be included. Market value is often the basis for "agreed value" insurance policies. It is crucial for policyholders to regularly update this valuation, ideally every two years, to avoid underinsurance due to potential appreciation.
 * Replacement Value: This is the amount required for the insured party to promptly obtain a replacement vehicle of the same kind and value in the event of a total loss. Unlike market value, replacement value primarily considers commercial trade and thus includes applicable taxes and dealer profit margins. Restoration costs or previous expenses are generally not factored into this value. Replacement value is commonly used for settling liability claims.
 * Restoration (Rebuild) Value: This value is a mathematical calculation representing the sum of the vehicle's acquisition cost plus all subsequent restoration costs, irrespective of whether this total sum could be achieved in a market sale. The difference between restoration value and market value can be significant. This figure is particularly relevant for vehicles that have undergone extensive, labor-intensive, and costly restorations.
For restomods, the "Restoration (Rebuild) Value" can often be considerably higher than the "Market Value," especially for builds driven by an owner's specific desires and where expenses may exceed what the broader market is willing to pay. An example provided illustrates a scenario where a restomod with $55,000 in build costs could secure an agreed insurance value at that amount, despite the stock equivalent being valued at $39,000, provided there is a detailed appraisal. This highlights that while some restomods, particularly owner-built or more basic projects, might be cheaper to build and maintain than a full concours restoration of a rare classic , high-end professional restomods often involve costs exceeding those of standard restorations due to the inclusion of expensive modern components. Indeed, professionally built restomods from renowned builders can achieve market values that meet or even surpass their substantial build costs, as seen in the million-dollar examples. For vehicle owners in Saint Joseph, particularly those with restomods, obtaining a proper appraisal that meticulously documents the quality and cost of modifications is essential. This documentation is key to securing appropriate "Agreed Value" insurance coverage, which acknowledges the unique and often expensive nature of these enhanced vehicles.
Current Market Values: Specific Makes and Models (Classic Cars)
The following section presents current market valuations for selected classic car models, primarily referencing Hagerty Valuation Tools. Values typically correspond to Condition #3 ("Good"), defined as a vehicle that is drivable, well-maintained, with flaws not generally noticeable to a casual observer. Where data is available, ranges for Condition #1 ("Concours" - restored to the highest standards, often better than new), Condition #2 ("Excellent" - a well-restored or an extremely well-maintained original), and Condition #4 ("Fair" - drivable but needing significant work) are also indicated. These values represent a snapshot based on data available up to mid-2025 and are subject to market fluctuations. Auction results from various sources supplement this data.
A. Ford Mustang (1965-1966 V8 Coupe & Fastback)
The first-generation Ford Mustang remains an enduring icon, with V8 models, particularly from 1965 and 1966, being highly sought after.
 * 1965 Ford Mustang V8 Coupe:
   * A 1965 Coupe with the 289cid/200hp 2bbl V8 (C-Code) in #3 condition is valued at approximately $21,700. The more potent 289cid/225hp 4bbl V8 (A-Code) in similar condition is valued around $25,300. Hagerty suggests an average price for a 1965 Mustang in good condition with average specifications is about $29,842.
   * Historically, these models have seen active trading. Over the last three years, the highest auction sale for a 1965 Mustang (all variants) was $315,700, with the lowest at $5,214, across 695 sales. Hagerty's data also indicates that a 1965 Mustang with the 289cid/200hp 2bbl engine in #3 Good condition was valued at $29,100, reflecting a -10.5% trend over the past year.
 * 1966 Ford Mustang V8 Coupe:
   * For 1966 models, a Coupe with the 289cid/200hp 2bbl V8 in #3 condition is valued around $20,300, while the 289cid/225hp 4bbl V8 version is approximately $25,800. The average price for a 1966 Mustang in good condition with average specs is about $32,664.
   * Auction data for 1966 Mustangs over the past three years shows a high sale of $253,800 and a low of $9,362, from 546 units sold. A 1966 Mustang with the 289cid/200hp 2bbl engine in #3 Good condition was valued at $20,300, showing an -11% trend over the past year.
 * 1965 Ford Mustang V8 Fastback:
   * The Fastback body style commands a premium. A 1965 Fastback with the 289cid/225hp 4bbl V8 (A-Code) in #3 condition is valued at $47,600.
   * Classic.com reports an average sale price for all 1965 Mustangs (including many V8s) at $42,869, with a top sale reaching $275,000.
 * 1966 Ford Mustang V8 Fastback:

   * Classic.com data for 1966 Mustangs shows an average sale price of $37,347 and a top sale of $235,000. A 1966 Fastback race car sold for $54,000 in February 2025.
Ford Mustang (1965-1966) V8 Valuation Matrix
| Year | Body Style | Engine (Hagerty #3 Value) | Hagerty #3 Value | Avg. Auction Range (All '65/'66) | Hagerty 1-Year Trend (#3, 200hp Cpe) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1965 | Coupe | 289cid/200hp 2bbl (C-Code) | $21,700  | $29,842 (avg good)  | -10.5%  |
| 1965 | Coupe | 289cid/225hp 4bbl (A-Code) | $25,300  |  |  |
| 1965 | Fastback | 289cid/225hp 4bbl (A-Code) | $47,600  |  |  |
| 1966 | Coupe | 289cid/200hp 2bbl (C-Code) | $20,300  | $32,664 (avg good)  | -11.0%  |
| 1966 | Coupe | 289cid/225hp 4bbl (A-Code) | $25,800  |  |  |
| 1966 | Fastback | 289cid/225hp 4bbl (A-Code) | $50,800  |  |  |
| Note: Avg. Auction Range from Hagerty for "good condition with average spec". Specific auction data for V8 Coupes/Fastbacks can vary significantly based on exact spec and condition. |  |  |  |  |  |
The Mustang market, particularly for these early V8 models, demonstrates that while "hero" variants like the K-Code Fastbacks (not detailed but implied by higher sales figures) command significant premiums, the more common V8 Coupes offer a relatively accessible entry point into classic Mustang ownership. However, even these accessible models have experienced some value softening recently, as indicated by Hagerty's 1-year trend data showing a decrease of 10.5% to 12% for certain configurations. This suggests a potential "buyer's market" for some Mustang models in Saint Joseph, but careful inspection for condition, originality, and documentation remains crucial, as top-tier examples continue to achieve strong prices. This softening could be a temporary market correction or part of a broader trend discussed later in this report.
B. Jaguar E-Type Series 1 Roadster (3.8L & 4.2L)
The Jaguar E-Type, often lauded as one of the most beautiful cars ever made , holds a special place in automotive history, with Series 1 Roadsters being particularly prized.
 * Series 1 3.8L Roadster (1961-1964):
   * These early models are highly desirable. Auction results show significant variation: a 1961 3.8L Roadster sold for $527,500 at Broad Arrow's Amelia Auction in 2024, while a 1962 example sold for $179,200 and a 1963 for $112,000 at their Monterey 2023 sale.
   * The extreme rarity of special versions, like the Lightweight Competition models (of which only 12 were made), places them in a category of their own, commanding multi-million dollar valuations.
 * Series 1 4.2L Roadster (1965-1967):
   * The Hagerty Price Guide values a 1967 E-Type Series 1 4.2L Roadster in #3 condition at $89,500, noting a -16.4% trend over the past year. However, auction results can be much higher for exceptional examples. A 1967 Series 1 Roadster reportedly sold for $880,000 at Mecum Kissimmee in January 2025, likely an outlier representing a car of extraordinary quality or provenance. In contrast, a 1966 4.2L Roadster, a three-time 100-point JCNA National Champion, sold for $467,500 via RM Sotheby's in 2013. A 1967 4.2L Roadster sold for $128,800 at Broad Arrow's Monterey 2023 sale.
   * Hagerty also lists a generic 1964 Jaguar E-Type (which could be a 3.8L) in #3 Good condition at $87,400, with an -11.5% trend.
Jaguar E-Type Series 1 Roadster Valuation Matrix
| Year Range | Engine | Hagerty #3 Value (Year Specific if Avail.) | Notable Recent Auction Sales (USD) | Hagerty 1-Year Trend (General E-Type S1) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1961-1964 | 3.8L | ~$87,400 ('64 model)  | $527,500 ('61) ; $179,200 ('62) ; $112,000 ('63)  | -11.5% ('64 model)  |
| 1965-1967 | 4.2L | $89,500 ('67 model)  | $880,000 ('67, exceptional) ; $467,500 ('66, champion) ; $128,800 ('67)  | -16.4% ('67 model)  |
| Note: Hagerty values are for #3 "Good" condition. Auction sales can vary dramatically based on provenance, restoration quality, and specific event dynamics. |  |  |  |  |
The E-Type market clearly demonstrates extreme variance. While average examples in #3 condition appear to be undergoing a market correction, with Hagerty indicating declines of 11.5% to 16.4% for certain model years , truly exceptional vehicles—those with impeccable documentation, concours-winning restorations, or significant rarity—continue to achieve world-class prices. This suggests a bifurcated market where provenance and ultimate quality create a "super-premium" tier. For an investor in Saint Joseph, an E-Type can be a high-reward prospect but also carries risk if not selecting a top-tier example. The enduring allure of its design, famously praised by Enzo Ferrari , ensures its continued cachet, but due diligence is more critical than ever.
C. Porsche 911 SWB Coupe (1965-1968, e.g., 2.0L Base and S models)
The early short-wheelbase (SWB) Porsche 911s are foundational to the model's legendary status and are highly coveted by collectors.
 * 1965 Porsche 911 2.0L Coupe:
   * Hagerty values a 1965 911 (2.0L/130hp) in #3 Good condition at $185,000, noting a significant +15.6% trend over the past year.
   * Auction sales over the last three years have ranged from $10,920 to $446,000 across 18 units sold. A #3 Good example sold for $190,400 at a Broad Arrow auction in March 2025. An earlier sale in 2015 by Iconic Auctioneers saw one fetch £133,875.
 * 1966 Porsche 911 2.0L Coupe:
   * A 1966 model sold for $201,600 at a Broad Arrow auction in April 2025.
 * 1967 Porsche 911 2.0L Coupe (Base & S):
   * Base (130hp): Hagerty values a 1967 911 2.0L base model in #3 Good condition at $79,000, with a +5.3% trend. A Bring a Trailer sale in March 2025 saw a '67 base model fetch $198,500.
   * S (160hp): The 'S' variant commands a substantial premium. A 1967 911 2.0 S prepared for rally competition was estimated at $250,000-$300,000 and sold for $220,000 by Gooding & Company in 2018. A highly original 1967 911 2.0 S sold for $335,000 by Gooding & Company in 2022.
 * 1968 Porsche 911 2.0L Coupe (Base, T, L):
   * Auction results for 1968 base models show wide variation: one sold for $19,687 (likely a project or poor condition example) while another achieved $100,800, both in April 2025. The 911T and 911L variants were also introduced, offering different levels of equipment and performance.
Porsche 911 SWB Coupe (1965-1968) Valuation Matrix
| Year | Model Variant | Engine | Hagerty #3 Value | Notable Auction Sales (USD) | Hagerty Trend |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1965 | 911 (Base) | 2.0L | $185,000  | $190,400 (Mar '25) ; Range $10.9k-$446k (last 3 yrs)  | +15.6%  |
| 1966 | 911 (Base) | 2.0L | N/A | $201,600 (Apr '25)  | N/A |
| 1967 | 911 (Base) | 2.0L | $79,000  | $198,500 (Mar '25)  | +5.3%  |
| 1967 | 911 S | 2.0L | N/A (signif. higher) | $220,000 (Rally, 2018) ; $335,000 (Original, 2022)  | N/A |
| 1968 | 911 (Base) | 2.0L | N/A | $19,687 - $100,800 (Apr '25)  | N/A |
| Note: Hagerty values are for #3 "Good" condition. 'N/A' indicates specific Hagerty #3 data for that precise sub-model/year was not in the provided snippets, but values can be inferred to be substantial, especially for 'S' models. |  |  |  |  |  |
The early SWB Porsche 911 market demonstrates robust appreciation for top-tier, original examples, particularly the 'S' models which carry a significant premium. Even well-maintained base models command impressive figures, as evidenced by recent auction results and positive Hagerty value trends for the 1965 and 1967 base models. However, the market is highly sensitive to condition and provenance, with a considerable drop-off in value for cars in lesser states or with unresolved issues, as illustrated by the wide range in auction prices for 1968 models. For collectors in Saint Joseph, SWB 911s represent a serious investment class. Original 'S' models are blue-chip assets. Base models offer a more accessible, though still substantial, entry into this exclusive segment, but condition and authenticity are absolutely paramount. The market for well-sorted examples appears strong and appreciating.
D. Chevrolet C10 Pickup (1967-1972, V8 Short Bed Fleetside)
The 1967-1972 generation of Chevrolet C10 pickups, often dubbed the "Action Line," has surged in popularity among collectors and customizers, with V8-powered Short Bed Fleetside models being particularly desirable.
 * 1967 Chevrolet C10 V8 Short Bed Fleetside:
   * Hagerty values a 1967 C10 Fleetside Short Bed with the 283cid/175hp V8 in #3 condition at $19,800 (showing a -1% trend), and one with the 327cid/220hp V8 at $21,200. The average value for a 1967 C10 in good condition is cited as $16,950.
   * Auction results show a highest sale of $330,000 for a '67 C10 in the last three years (103 sold), though such a price typically indicates an exceptional restoration or a high-end restomod. A Barrett-Jackson sale in April 2025 saw a '67 C10 (likely modified) fetch $93,500.
 * 1968-1970 Chevrolet C10 V8 Short Bed Fleetside:
   * Specific Hagerty #3 values for V8 Short Bed Fleetsides in these years are not directly available in the snippets, but can be inferred to be above the 6-cylinder base values (around $16,000 for a 1972 6-cyl ).
   * The average sale price for a 2nd Gen C10 (1967-72) is $36,680, with a top sale of $264,000 for a 1969 Custom Pickup. A 1968 C10 sold on Bring a Trailer in May 2025 for $27,300. A 1970 C10 1/2 Ton sold at Barrett-Jackson in April 2025 for $49,500.
 * 1971-1972 Chevrolet C10 V8 Short Bed Fleetside:
   * These years are noted as particularly popular due to their "egg crate" grille design and the availability of factory front disc brakes.
   * Hagerty values a 1971 C10 Fleetside Short Bed 6-cylinder in #3 condition at $16,000; V8 models would be higher. A 1971 C10 1/2 Ton sold on Bring a Trailer in April 2025 for $23,100.
   * For 1972 models, Hagerty values a 6-cylinder Fleetside Short Bed in #3 condition at $16,000, with an average value for a '72 C10 in good condition cited at $23,813. The highest auction sale for a '72 C10 in the last three years was $253,000 (229 sold). Classic.com shows an average sale price for 1972 C10s at $38,771, with a top sale of $154,000.
Chevrolet C10 Pickup (1967-1972) V8 Short Bed Fleetside Valuation Matrix

| 1972 | 350cid V8 | $16,000 (6-cyl base)  (V8 higher) | Avg $38,771; Top $154k ; Highest $253k (last 3 yrs)  | Stable to Slight + |
| Note: Hagerty #3 values for V8 Short Bed Fleetsides are estimated where not directly provided, based on 6-cyl values and typical V8 premiums. High auction sales often reflect significant restoration or restomodding. |  |  |  |  |
The market for 1967-1972 Chevrolet C10 pickups is exceptionally robust, especially for well-restored or tastefully restomodded examples. These trucks frequently achieve prices that far exceed standard #3 condition values for stock examples. Key desirability factors include the short bed configuration and V8 power. The 1971 and 1972 models are particularly favored for their grille design and factory front disc brakes, enhancing their appeal to collectors and modifiers alike. This strong market performance indicates that for enthusiasts in Saint Joseph, a C10 can serve as both a usable classic and a potentially strong investment, provided it is acquired judiciously or restored/restomodded to a high standard. These trucks are prime candidates for the restomod treatment, a segment explored further in this report.
E. Chevrolet Camaro (e.g., 1969 V8 Sport Coupe/SS/Z28)
The 1969 Chevrolet Camaro stands as one of the most iconic muscle cars, with values varying significantly based on trim level and powertrain.
 * 1969 Chevrolet Camaro V8 Sport Coupe (Base Engines):
   * Hagerty values for #3 condition base V8 Sport Coupes are: $24,600 for the 307cid/200hp (L14), showing a -2% trend; $26,800 for the 327cid/210hp (LF7); and $28,900 for the 350cid/250hp (L65). The average price for a 1969 Camaro in good condition with average specifications is around $29,650.
 * 1969 Chevrolet Camaro SS (e.g., SS350, SS396):
   * While specific Hagerty #3 values for SS models are not directly listed, package options significantly increase value. For instance, the RS (Rally Sport) package alone can add approximately 20% to the base value. The SS package, with its performance engine and appearance upgrades, would command a similar or greater premium. Auction results for genuine SS models reflect this.
 * 1969 Chevrolet Camaro Z/28:

 * Mecum Kissimmee 2025 saw impressive sales, including a 1971 Chevrolet C10 Custom Pickup for $200,750 and a 1972 Chevrolet C10 Cheyenne Super Pickup (often heavily modified) for $165,000. Many high-selling C10s at this auction were effectively restomods, featuring modern LS or even Duramax diesel engines, upgraded suspensions, and custom interiors.
Key value drivers for C10 restomods include LS engine swaps (often with forced induction), modern automatic transmissions, upgraded chassis from specialists like Total Cost Involved (TCI), Roadster Shop, or RideTech, high-quality paint finishes, bespoke interiors with modern amenities such as Vintage Air, large-diameter wheels, and comprehensive disc brake conversions.
The consistent achievement of six-figure prices at major auctions for C10s equipped with modern powertrains, sophisticated chassis upgrades, and high-end finishes confirms a robust and well-funded market segment. The designation of "award winner" for some of these trucks further points to the level of quality and investment expected at the top end of this market. For enthusiasts in Saint Joseph, the C10 platform offers immense potential for creating a valuable and enjoyable restomod. However, the prevalence of professional, high-dollar builds means that achieving premium prices requires top-notch quality, meticulous attention to detail, and the use of desirable, proven components.
C. Chevrolet Camaro Restomods (Primarily 1967-1969)
First-generation Chevrolet Camaros, especially the 1969 model, are premier candidates for high-dollar restomod builds. When executed to an exceptional standard with top-tier components and by reputable builders, these restomods can achieve values far exceeding those of original high-performance models like the Z/28 or SS. The average sale price for a 2nd Gen (1970-1981) Custom Camaro is around $74,559, with a top sale recorded at $385,000 for the "The Grinch," a 1970 Camaro. First-generation restomods often command even higher figures.
A prime example of a top-tier first-generation Camaro restomod is the 1968 Chevrolet Camaro Custom Coupe nicknamed "Rhodium," an EBMC creation featuring a Chris Alston's Chassisworks gStreet chassis, Forgeline wheels, Wilwood brakes, a ProCharger-equipped LT4 V8 engine, and a Tremec T56 Magnum 6-speed manual transmission. This vehicle sold for $385,000 at the Barrett-Jackson Scottsdale 2025 auction. Listings from Mecum's Indy 2025 auction also include examples like a 1969 Camaro Custom with a 502 CI V8, indicative of the types of powerful engine upgrades common in these builds.
Key value drivers for Camaro restomods include modern LS or LT engine swaps (often supercharged or turbocharged), high-performance manual or automatic transmissions, substantially upgraded chassis and suspension systems (from specialists like Chassisworks, Art Morrison, or Roadster Shop), high-performance braking systems (Wilwood, Baer), fully custom interiors with modern conveniences, high-end paint and bodywork, and sometimes subtle or extensive body modifications such as widebody kits.
The $385,000 sale of the "Rhodium" Camaro  and the similar top sale for a custom 1970 model  clearly demonstrate the peak market potential for these vehicles. Such prices are significantly above the values for even #3 Good condition original Z/28s (around $96,700 ). This indicates that, much like with Mustangs and C10s, a substantial investment in quality components, design, and professional craftsmanship is required for Camaro restomods to reach the upper echelons of market value. The "Pro-Touring" style, which combines classic muscle car aesthetics with modern sports car performance and handling, is highly desirable in this segment. For builders and buyers in Saint Joseph, focusing on proven component combinations from reputable manufacturers and ensuring impeccable execution are critical for success in the high-end Camaro restomod market.
D. Porsche 911 "Backdate" and High-End Restomods (e.g., Singer, Gunther Werks style)
This segment represents the zenith of the restomod market, where vehicles are often completely re-engineered and meticulously handcrafted to create automotive works of art. These builds typically use later air-cooled Porsche 911s (often the 964 or 993 generation) as a base, "backdating" their appearance to resemble earlier, iconic 911s, while incorporating state-of-the-art performance and materials. Values are exceptionally high, frequently ranging from $500,000 to well over $1 million.
Examples and market data illustrate this exclusive tier:
 * Companies like Singer Vehicle Design and Gunther Werks are renowned for their Porsche 911 "reimaginations." A 1991 Singer DLS (Dynamics and Lightweighting Study) sold for $3 million, a 1990 Porsche 911 Reimagined by Singer fetched $1.16 million, and a 1996 Porsche 911 Speedster "remastered" by Gunther Werks sold for $1.215 million. Bonhams listed a 1995 Porsche 911 Speedster Remastered by Gunther Werks with an estimate of $1.2 million - $1.4 million. RM Sotheby's also listed a 1995 Porsche 911 Remastered by Gunther Werks for its Arizona 2025 auction, implying a similarly high valuation.
 * Tuthill Porsche is another notable name, with projects like the GT One (based on a 1990s Porsche Le Mans race car) and bespoke 911K builds.
 * Even dealer-commissioned backdates, if executed thoughtfully, can achieve significant status and value. A 1991 Porsche 964 Targa "Backdate" by Porsche Zentrum Moers, featuring a reconditioned 3.6-liter flat-six, KW coilover suspension, and Porsche Classic Communication Management (PCCM), was offered with price "on application," indicative of its high value and quality, even qualifying for Germany's historic vehicle registration.
 * Less extensive custom and restomod Porsche 911Es (1969-1973) have an average sale price of $97,548, with a top sale of $215,000, according to Classic.com data. These are generally less comprehensive transformations than those by Singer or Gunther Werks.
Key value drivers in this ultra-high-end segment include the choice of base car (typically a Porsche 964 or 993 for backdating projects), the unparalleled level of craftsmanship and bespoke engineering, the use of high-performance air-cooled or specially developed engines, extensive use of lightweight materials like carbon fiber for bodywork, entirely custom-designed and exquisitely finished interiors, the powerful brand reputation and exclusivity of the modifying company, and extremely limited production numbers.
These vehicles are in a different league from typical restomods. Their multi-million dollar valuations are driven by extreme quality, the unique brand cachet of the modifier, and their inherent exclusivity. The level of engineering and artistry often results in a vehicle that transcends the original donor car, becoming a new, distinct creation. While this segment is largely aspirational for the average collector or builder in Saint Joseph due to the immense costs and specialized expertise required, it serves as a benchmark for quality and innovation within the broader restomod movement. It demonstrates the ultimate potential of the restomod concept and influences trends in terms of material use, integration of technology, and the pursuit of perfection in blending classic design with modern capabilities.
E. Cost vs. Value in Restomod Builds
The economics of restomodding present a complex interplay between initial investment and final market value. Basic restomod projects might range from $25,000 to $50,000 for simpler modifications. More extensive builds, involving significant powertrain, chassis, and cosmetic work, can easily surpass $100,000. High-end, professionally executed restomods, as seen in the auction examples for Mustangs, C10s, and Camaros, frequently trade in the $200,000 to $500,000+ range. The pinnacle, represented by Singer and Gunther Werks Porsches, reaches into the millions.
The relationship between build cost and market value is not always linear. While some argue that building and maintaining a restomod can be cheaper than a full restoration of a rare classic (likely referring to owner-assisted or simpler builds) , others note that restomods typically cost more due to the expense of modern high-performance parts. The critical factor is whether the investment translates into perceived market value. A "properly restomodded 1958 Corvette," for example, is cited as being worth "exponentially more when complete than it costs to build," highlighting the potential for significant value creation with the right base vehicle and build strategy. Conversely, poorly executed or overly personalized restomods may struggle to recoup their build costs and can be hard to sell, sometimes fetching less than a clean original example. Stuart Wilson of Velocity Restorations, a company known for high-value restomods , has pointed out the risks associated with "not very well built" restomods that lack customer service or warranty support. Furthermore, Tom Wagner, an investor in Singer, noted that many restomod companies struggle with profitability and scaling their operations.
There exists a critical inflection point where the investment in a restomod build can lead to a substantial increase in value over the original car (and potentially a profit over the build cost itself), or it can result in a vehicle worth less than the sum of its parts and labor. This outcome heavily depends on the initial desirability of the base car, the quality, tastefulness, and market acceptance of the modifications, and the reputation of the builder or shop that performed the work. The ambitious $400,000 asking price for the award-winning but unsold 1965 Mustang restomod  illustrates the challenge of aligning high build costs with market willingness to pay, whereas the consistent high auction prices for professionally built vehicles from recognized names like Velocity or those featuring components from Roadster Shop or Art Morrison demonstrate market validation for quality.
For individuals in Saint Joseph contemplating a restomod build, particularly as an investment, meticulous planning, realistic budgeting, the selection of a desirable base vehicle, the use of high-quality and widely accepted components, and professional execution are paramount. Building for personal enjoyment allows for more latitude in choices, but if resale value or profit is a goal, the build must align with broader market preferences. Comprehensive documentation of the entire build process, including all parts and labor costs, is crucial for substantiating the vehicle's value to potential buyers and insurers.
Future Market Projections (5-20 Years)
Projecting the future value of classic cars and restomods requires an analysis of overall market growth, specific segment trends, demographic shifts, technological impacts, and broader economic factors. The outlook for Saint Joseph collectors will be shaped by these interconnected forces.
A. Overall Classic Car Market Growth
The classic car market, as a whole, is anticipated to experience robust growth in the coming decade.
 * Quantitative Projections: The U.S. Classic Cars Market is forecasted to expand from approximately $12.61 billion in 2024 to an estimated $24.78 billion by 2032, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.82%. Globally, the market is projected to grow from $39.7 billion in 2024 to $77.8 billion by 2032, at a CAGR of 8.7%.
 * Key Drivers: This growth is underpinned by several factors, including the increasing investment appeal of classic cars as tangible assets, advancements in restoration technologies and services making ownership more accessible, rising disposable incomes among potential buyers, the enduring cultural significance and nostalgic appeal of vintage automobiles, and the proliferation of online auction platforms and digital marketplaces that broaden market reach and transparency.
While these aggregate growth figures paint a positive picture, it is important to recognize that this expansion is unlikely to be uniform across all segments of the classic car market. Recent market analyses from sources like Hagerty indicate periods of cooling and price corrections for certain types of vehicles after a significant pandemic-era boom. This suggests that while the overall market value is increasing, specific categories—such as pre-war cars, American muscle, European sports cars, or emerging modern classics—may experience different growth trajectories. For investors and collectors in Saint Joseph, this implies that a broad assumption of appreciation for any classic car is unwise; rather, a nuanced understanding of specific segment trends will be crucial for successful long-term investment.
B. Restomod Market Growth & Trends
The restomod segment is poised for continued and potentially accelerated growth, driven by evolving enthusiast preferences and technological advancements.
 * Qualitative Projections: Experts and market observers anticipate strong ongoing expansion in the restomod market. This is fueled by shifting demographics favoring vehicles that combine classic aesthetics with modern usability, the increasing accessibility of advanced automotive technology, and the investment potential of high-quality, professionally executed builds. The SEMA market research has identified restomodding as a significant growth sector within the classic market.
 * Quantitative Projections (Automotive Restoration): The global automotive restoration market, which encompasses restomodding activities, was estimated at $5.5 billion in 2022 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 11.2% through 2030. (Note: The source snippet  contains a typographical error stating the market will reach $2.3 billion by 2030 from $5.5 billion in 2022 with a positive CAGR; this analysis assumes the CAGR applies to growth from the 2022 base.) This growth is driven by the increasing collection of vintage cars and rising purchasing power.
 * Emerging Trends:
   * "Modern Classics" as Platforms: Vehicles from the 1990s and early 2000s are increasingly becoming popular bases for restomod projects, appealing to Millennial and Gen Z buyers.
   * Technological Integration: While already a hallmark of restomods, the future will likely see more sophisticated integration of modern infotainment systems, and potentially advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) in very high-end builds, mirroring trends in new vehicle technology.
   * Sustainability and "Electromods": A significant and rapidly growing trend is the conversion of classic cars to electric powertrains, discussed in more detail in section VI.D.
The restomod market is likely to outpace the traditional classic car market in terms of innovation and, for certain desirable platforms and high-quality builds, potentially in value growth. The very definition of "restomod" is also broadening as builders experiment with new technologies and platforms. For the Saint Joseph market, this signifies expanding opportunities for specialized restoration and modification shops, as well as for collectors seeking classic cars that offer a contemporary driving experience. However, the increasing cost and complexity of top-tier restomods  mean that not all projects will be financially viable as investments or easily marketable without a clear understanding of current tastes and quality benchmarks.
C. Influence of Demographic Shifts (Gen X, Millennials, Gen Z)
A profound demographic shift is underway in the collector car market, with younger generations—Gen X, Millennials, and Gen Z—exerting increasing influence on trends and values.
 * Shifting Nostalgia: These younger enthusiasts are often drawn to vehicles from the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s—the cars of their youth, often termed "youngtimers" or "modern classics". Examples include Japanese sports cars like the Nissan Skyline GT-R and Toyota Supra, European models like the BMW M3 and Porsche 911 (964/993/996 generations), and American performance cars from these eras.
 * Greater Acceptance of Modifications: Younger generations are generally more receptive to modified vehicles and the integration of modern technology, which aligns well with the restomod philosophy.
 * Growing Market Share: Hagerty research indicates that Gen Z (born 1997-2012) expresses significantly greater interest (60%) in owning a classic car compared to Baby Boomers (31%). Gen Z's top insurance inquiry is for the 1990-1998 Mazda Miata, while Millennials show strong interest in 1988-2000 GMT400 series trucks. Hagerty also predicts that Gen Z will account for over 10% of insurance quotes by the end of 2025, up from 8%.
This generational transition means the "nostalgia curve" is advancing. Vehicles that were once common daily drivers are now becoming sought-after collectibles. Conversely, some cars cherished by the Baby Boomer generation may experience softer demand and value plateaus or declines, unless they possess exceptional rarity, historical significance, or concours-level quality. The Hagerty Hundred index, representing mainstream insured classics, is at an inflation-adjusted all-time low, potentially making entry into the market easier for these younger buyers. For collectors in Saint Joseph, these demographic trends are critical for long-term acquisition strategies. Investing in well-preserved or desirable models from the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s may offer greater appreciation potential over the next 10 to 20 years compared to some more traditional, but relatively common, classics from earlier eras.
D. Impact of Electrification (EV Conversions) on Values
The electrification of classic cars, creating "electromods," is a rapidly emerging and transformative trend with significant implications for market values.
 * Market Growth: The global electric classic car market was valued at approximately $2.5 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach around $12.3 billion by 2032, growing at a remarkable CAGR of 19.8%.
 * Value Impact: EV conversions can dramatically increase the market value of certain classic cars. Reports suggest some converted classics can be worth up to 20 times more than their original counterparts, with models like the MG MGB Roadster seeing over a 2,000% value increase post-conversion. Less valuable models like the Nissan Bluebird and Rover Mini have seen jumps of around 700%. High-end electric restomods of popular American classics are also commanding strong prices, such as a 1972 Chevrolet C10 Electric (450 HP, 200-mile range) valued between $150,000-$200,000, and Tesla-swapped 1967 Ford Mustang EVs selling for $300,000+.
 * Drivers: This trend is driven by increasing environmental awareness, the desire for improved reliability and performance, lower running costs, and the appeal of blending vintage aesthetics with modern, sustainable technology. Government incentives and stricter emissions regulations in some areas also play a role.
 * Pros: Benefits include enhanced performance (instant torque), smoother and quieter operation, improved reliability (fewer moving parts), reduced emissions, lower fuel and maintenance costs, and the potential for daily usability.
 * Cons and Challenges: The primary challenges include the high cost of conversion (a DIY MGB conversion with used Tesla batteries cost $17,000 plus the donor car ), the ongoing debate about the impact on a car's originality and historical value (particularly among purists) , and current limitations in battery technology related to cost, safety, and range.
EV conversion is a disruptive force, carving out a new sub-segment in the classic and restomod market. It can substantially enhance the usability and market value of certain classics, especially those that are not exceptionally rare or valuable in their original form. For these vehicles, electrification offers a path to renewed relevance and appeal to a modern, environmentally conscious demographic. However, for blue-chip, highly original, and historically significant collectibles, an EV conversion could be viewed by traditional collectors as detrimental to its authenticity and value. The decision to convert is therefore a strategic one, heavily dependent on the specific car, the quality of the conversion, and the owner's objectives. For owners in Saint Joseph, an EV conversion could be a viable route to modernize a less rare classic, making it more enjoyable for regular use and potentially increasing its value within a specific, growing market segment.
E. Role of Technology (ADAS, Infotainment, Restoration Tech)
Technological advancements are influencing the classic and restomod markets in several ways, from how cars are restored and maintained to the features integrated into them.
 * Restoration Technology: Modern technologies such as 3D printing are providing solutions for recreating rare or discontinued parts, making it easier and potentially more cost-effective to restore classic cars while maintaining authenticity. Advanced diagnostic tools, including AI-powered systems, can streamline maintenance and identify issues more accurately. Digital documentation of service and restoration work is also becoming more common, enhancing a vehicle's provenance and value.
 * Restomod Integration: Restomods inherently benefit from technological integration. Common upgrades include modern infotainment systems (often with touchscreen displays, navigation, and smartphone connectivity), digital instrument clusters designed to mimic classic styles, climate control, and upgraded audio systems.
 * Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS): While full ADAS suites as seen in new cars  are not typically found in most restomods due to complexity and the desire to maintain a classic driving feel, very high-end restomod builds are beginning to incorporate elements like modern anti-lock braking systems (ABS), traction control, and improved lighting for enhanced safety and drivability. The general trend of increasing technological sophistication in new vehicles  will likely influence expectations for top-tier restomods aiming to offer a truly contemporary driving experience.
Technology is effectively lowering some barriers to owning and maintaining older vehicles by improving parts availability and diagnostic capabilities. Simultaneously, it is pushing the boundaries of what is achievable in restomodding, allowing for greater performance, comfort, and safety. This dual impact could lead to an increased supply of well-sorted classic cars and highly sophisticated restomods in the market. For restorers and enthusiasts in Saint Joseph, these technologies offer new tools and possibilities. Buyers, particularly of restomods, will increasingly expect a certain level of modern convenience and performance, and even well-restored classics will benefit from the improved parts sourcing and maintenance techniques enabled by new technologies.
F. Economic and Market Factors
The classic car market, including restomods, is not insulated from broader economic conditions and market cycles.
 * Market Cooling/Correction: After a period of intense activity and price escalation during the COVID-19 pandemic, the collector car market has shown signs of cooling and correction. The Hagerty Market Rating, which measures market "heat," has fluctuated, indicating a complex and segmented market rather than uniform growth or decline. It has moved from "flat market" territory back to "expanding market" status in early 2025, but with underlying caution from experts. However, other reports show the rating dipping into "flat market" territory (scores in the 50s) for the first time since 2020 , and the Market Index has generally trended downwards since its peak in late 2022. The median sale price at auctions has also seen declines, reaching new lows when adjusted for inflation.
 * Macroeconomic Influences: Factors such as inflation, interest rates, and overall economic confidence significantly impact discretionary spending on high-value collectibles like classic cars. Uncertainty in political, social, financial, and economic spheres can lead buyers and sellers to hold back.
 * Investment Returns: While classic cars can appreciate, they are also considered a risky investment. Hagerty found that collector cars had an average annualized return of 4.6% from 2018-2023. However, individual vehicle performance can vary wildly, and costs for maintenance, restoration, insurance, and storage must be factored in.
 * Expert Outlook: Industry experts have noted repeat sales occurring at a loss and fewer record-setting prices compared to the peak years. There's a sentiment that the market has returned to a "pre-pandemic normal". While some high-end segments remain strong, the broader market is more price-sensitive. Hagerty's experts predict that the bottom end of the market (mainstream vehicles) will continue to fall in value, potentially creating entry opportunities for younger buyers.
The classic car market is subject to economic cycles. The intense activity and price surges seen during the pandemic have given way to a more discerning and price-conscious environment. While long-term growth for the overall market is projected , short-to-medium-term volatility and segment-specific corrections are likely. The dramatic 47% drop in value from its 2017 peak for a specific 1959 Ferrari 250 GT LWB California Spider Competizione, selling for $9.465 million at Amelia Island in 2025 (down from $17.99 million), is a stark illustration of this correction at the very high end. For buyers and sellers in Saint Joseph, this environment necessitates realistic value expectations, thorough due diligence, and sound financial planning. The market may present more opportunities for buyers in certain segments, with less frenzied bidding and potentially longer times to conclude sales.
G. Future of ICE Classics vs. Restomods/EVs
The future automotive landscape will likely see the coexistence of traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) classics, modernized ICE restomods, and electric-converted classics (electromods).
 * Endurance of ICE Classics: Pure, original ICE classic cars, especially those with significant rarity, historical importance, or iconic status, will continue to be cherished and hold value within the collector community. Major enthusiast brands like Porsche have committed to selling ICE-powered models, such as the 911, well into the 2030s alongside their EV offerings, acknowledging the enduring appeal of the traditional combustion engine experience.
 * Rise of Usable Alternatives: However, factors such as increasing emissions regulations, potential restrictions on ICE vehicle use in urban areas (low-emission zones), and the desire for enhanced reliability and performance are driving the popularity of restomods and electromods. These modified vehicles offer a way to enjoy classic styling with modern practicality and, in the case of EVs, a reduced environmental footprint.
 * Dual Market Development: A dual market is expected to solidify: one catering to purist collectors focused on originality and historical preservation (often for concours events and investment), and another for enthusiasts who prioritize regular drivability, modern comfort, performance, and potentially environmental considerations. The choice between an original ICE classic, an ICE restomod, or an electromod will increasingly depend on the individual owner's priorities and how they intend to use the vehicle.
For collectors and enthusiasts in Saint Joseph, this evolving landscape offers a wider spectrum of choices. The "best" path will depend on individual goals—be it preserving automotive history, enjoying a thrilling analogue driving experience, seeking a reliable classic for frequent use, making an investment, or embracing sustainable technology within a classic form.

The rise of younger generations (Gen X, Millennials, and Gen Z) is undeniably shifting preferences towards "modern classics" from the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s, vehicles that offer a blend of nostalgic appeal and more contemporary engineering.
Restomods represent a vibrant and expanding sector, driven by the desire to combine timeless automotive design with modern performance, reliability, and comfort. High-quality restomods, particularly those based on popular platforms like early Ford Mustangs, Chevrolet C10s, and first-generation Camaros, are achieving significant market values, often comparable to or exceeding their pristine original counterparts. However, the value of a restomod is intrinsically linked to the quality of the build, the components used, the reputation of the builder, and the tastefulness of the modifications. Poorly executed or overly personalized projects risk failing to recoup their investment. The pinnacle of this segment, exemplified by Porsche 911 reimaginations from firms like Singer and Gunther Werks, demonstrates the extraordinary values achievable through unparalleled craftsmanship and bespoke engineering, albeit at a cost that places them in an exclusive stratum.
Technological advancements are playing a dual role: facilitating the restoration and maintenance of original classics through innovations like 3D printing for rare parts, while simultaneously enabling more sophisticated and integrated restomod conversions. The emergence of "electromods"—classic cars converted to electric powertrains—is a particularly dynamic trend, projected for rapid growth and offering a unique blend of vintage style and zero-emission motoring. While potentially adding substantial value to certain vehicles, electrification also sparks debate among purists regarding authenticity.
Economic factors will continue to influence the market. The post-pandemic boom has given way to a more measured and price-sensitive environment. Buyers and sellers in Saint Joseph should anticipate a market that demands thorough due diligence, realistic valuations, and an understanding that not all segments will appreciate uniformly. Professional appraisals are crucial, especially for high-value classics and unique restomods, to ensure accurate valuation for insurance and potential sale.
Ultimately, the decision to acquire, restore, or modify a classic vehicle in Saint Joseph should align with individual goals—whether for pure enjoyment, investment, frequent usability, or historical preservation. The future market will offer diverse pathways. While this report provides a broad analysis based on national and international data, local market conditions, the presence of specialized service and builder communities in and around Saint Joseph, and regional enthusiast preferences will also play a role in shaping values and opportunities.
