## Next Steps to Get REAL Data

### Option 1: Setup MCP Playwright Server
If MCP Playwright becomes available:
```bash
# 1. Configure MCP Playwright
# 2. Use scripts/collect-real-vehicles.ts framework
# 3. Scrape 1000+ real listings
# 4. Update sourceType to 'import'
```

### Option 2: Install Playwright Locally
If browser downloads are unblocked:
```bash
npm install playwright
npx playwright install chromium
npx tsx scripts/scrape-with-playwright.ts
```

### Option 3: Use Firecrawl MCP (Recommended)
Best for structured extraction at scale:
```bash
# Cost: $20-40 for 1000 vehicles
# Time: 2-4 hours
# Quality: Highest (LLM-based extraction)
```

### Option 4: Manual Data Partnership
Contact Gateway Classic Cars, CLASSIC.COM for API access or data feed.

### Option 5: Replace Gradually
Keep market research data, manually add 10-20 real listings weekly.

## Files Created

### Scripts
- `scripts/populate-enhanced-market-vehicles.ts` - Market research vehicle generator
- `scripts/clear-vehicles.ts` - Database cleanup utility
- `scripts/verify-database.ts` - Data quality verification

### Documentation
- `docs/CLASSIC-CAR-WEBSITES-RESEARCH.md` - 17 major platforms analyzed
- `docs/REAL-DATA-COLLECTION-ASSESSMENT.md` - Feasibility analysis
- `docs/REAL-DATA-COLLECTION-LIMITATIONS.md` - Technical blocks
- `docs/MCP-SERVER-INVESTIGATION.md` - MCP availability check
- `docs/MCP-SERVICES-EVALUATION-AND-STRATEGY.md` - Firecrawl vs Playwright vs Perplexity

## Testing Phase 5 UI

Even with synthetic data, all Phase 5 features are fully functional:

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Test routes:
http://localhost:5000/vehicles/1          # VehicleDetailPage
http://localhost:5000/mustang             # MakeHubPage
http://localhost:5000/events/1            # EventVehicleLinks
http://localhost:5000/search?q=corvette   # Search with 196 Corvettes
```

### What Works
✅ Vehicle search and filtering
✅ Price trend charts (5,481 real data points)
✅ Event-vehicle cross-linking (17 events)
✅ Investment grade calculations
✅ Make/Model hub pages (SEO-ready)
✅ "See at Shows" functionality

---

## Recommendation

**Short-term:** Deploy with current market research data to validate Phase 5 UI/UX

**Long-term:** Setup Firecrawl MCP for real scraping OR establish data partnership

**Important:** All vehicles clearly marked as `sourceType: 'research'` in database for transparency.
