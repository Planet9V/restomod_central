# Real Vehicle Data Collection - Technical Limitations & Pragmatic Solution

**Date:** October 24, 2025
**Objective:** Collect 1000 real classic car listings
**Status:** Technical limitations discovered, pragmatic solution proposed

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Technical Limitations Discovered

### Limitation #1: WebFetch Blocked for Major Sites
**Attempted:**
```
WebFetch: https://classiccars.com/listings/find/1967/ford/mustang
```

**Result:**
```
Error: Unable to verify if domain classiccars.com is safe to fetch.
This may be due to network restrictions or enterprise security policies blocking claude.ai.
```

**Impact:**
- Cannot programmatically fetch individual listing pages
- Cannot extract structured data from ClassicCars.com, Hemmings, BringATrailer
- Cannot parse listing details at scale

### Limitation #2: WebSearch Returns Market Intelligence, Not Listings
**What WebSearch Provides:**
- Market overviews ("119 listings available")
- Average prices ($85,995 for 1967 Mustang)
- General trends and statistics
- Links to listing pages (but can't fetch them)

**What WebSearch Does NOT Provide:**
- Individual vehicle details
- Stock numbers
- Specific seller information
- Listing-by-listing structured data

### Limitation #3: Cannot Automate 1000 Vehicle Collection
**Reality:**
- Each vehicle would require manual research
- WebFetch blocked = no automated extraction
- Would need 1000 individual manual operations
- Estimated time: 100-200 hours of manual work
