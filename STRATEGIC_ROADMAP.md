# Strategic Roadmap: RestoMod Central
## Creating the Ultimate Classic Car Platform for Enthusiasts & Investors

**Target Users:** Car enthusiasts, investors, classic car buyers, show attendees, researchers
**Business Model:** Free platform driving awareness, research, and purchasing decisions
**Core Strategy:** Connect events → research → valuation → purchase

---

## 🎯 Vision: The Complete Classic Car Ecosystem

**Your Unique Position:**
1. **Event Discovery** - Most comprehensive car show calendar (175+ Midwest events, expanding nationally)
2. **Investment Intelligence** - Price history tracking, appreciation analytics, market trends
3. **Purchase Tools** - FTS5 search, vehicle comparison, valuation over time
4. **Research Hub** - Articles, market insights, make/model analysis

**Competitive Advantage:**
- Bring a Trailer → Auctions only (no calendar, limited research)
- Hemmings → Marketplace focus (outdated events calendar)
- ClassicCars.com → Sales listings (no investment analytics)
- **You → Complete ecosystem that connects seeing, learning, valuing, and buying**

---

## 🚀 Phase 5: Complete the Event-to-Purchase Journey

**Current State:**
✅ 175+ Midwest events imported
✅ Southern/Eastern event import scripts ready
✅ Event filtering, search, itinerary features
✅ Nearby cars API endpoint (`/events/:id/nearby-cars`)

**What's Missing:** The connections between events and purchases

---

### 5A. Event Enhancement (Week 1) - Make Events Comprehensive

#### 1. **Complete National Coverage** 🗺️ Priority: IMMEDIATE

**Action Items:**
```bash
# Import all regional events
npm run import:events  # Midwest (already done - 175+)
tsx scripts/import-southern-eastern-shows.ts  # South + East
```

**Add Western States Coverage:**
- Create `scripts/import-western-shows.ts`
- Target regions: California, Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Colorado
- Major events to include:
  - Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance (CA)
  - Barrett-Jackson Scottsdale (AZ)
  - Monterey Car Week (CA)
  - LA Auto Show Classic Car Section
  - Portland Swap Meet (OR)

**Goal:** 500+ events across all 50 states

---

#### 2. **Keep Events Up-to-Date** 📅 Priority: HIGH

**Problem:** Events are time-sensitive. Stale data = lost trust.

**Solution: Automated Event Management**

Create event update system:
```typescript
// New file: server/services/eventUpdateService.ts

export class EventUpdateService {
  // Mark past events as "completed"
  async archivePastEvents() {
    const yesterday = new Date();
    yesterday.setDate(yesterday.getDate() - 1);

    await db.update(carShowEvents)
      .set({ status: 'completed' })
      .where(lt(carShowEvents.endDate, yesterday));
  }

  // Flag events needing verification (>1 year old)
  async flagStaleEvents() {
    const oneYearAgo = new Date();
    oneYearAgo.setFullYear(oneYearAgo.getFullYear() - 1);

    // Mark for manual review
  }

  // Recurring event generator
  async generateRecurringEvents() {
    // For annual events, auto-create next year's entry
    // Example: "Downtown Naperville Classic Car Show" happens every year
  }
}
```

**Implementation:**
- Add cron job to run daily: archive past events
- Add admin dashboard section for event management
- Allow users to "suggest edit" for outdated info
- Track event data freshness in UI

---

#### 3. **Event-to-Vehicle Connections** 🔗 Priority: HIGH

**Current:** `/events/:id/nearby-cars` endpoint exists but not visible in UI

**Enhance Event Detail Page:**

```typescript
// client/src/pages/EventDetailsPage.tsx - Add these sections:

1. "Vehicles You Might See at This Show"
   - Query nearby cars by state/region
   - Filter by event category (muscle show → muscle cars)
   - Display 6-12 vehicles with images
   - "See all vehicles in [State]" link

2. "For Sale Near This Event"
   - Same nearby cars but filter by:
     - Within 50 miles of event
     - Similar category/era
   - Price range targeting event attendees
   - "Contact seller before the show" CTA

3. "Investment Opportunities"
   - Show vehicles with:
     - High investment grades (A+, A)
     - Rising price trends (>10% appreciation)
     - Similar to show featured cars
   - Analytics: "Cars like these appreciated 15% last year"

4. "Plan Your Trip"
   - Add to itinerary button (already exists ✅)
   - Nearby hotels (Google Places API)
   - Weather forecast (OpenWeather API)
   - Other events same weekend
   - Export to calendar (ICS file)
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Events drive **awareness** → "I saw this Mustang at the show, now I want one"
- Nearby cars drive **action** → "I can see this for sale car at the show"
- Investment data drives **confidence** → "This is a smart purchase"

---

#### 4. **Post-Event Engagement** 📸 Priority: MEDIUM

**Problem:** Event ends, engagement dies.

**Solution: Event Recap & Community**

**Features:**
- User-submitted photos from events
- "Best of Show" voting
- Event results and winners
- Attendance tracking
- Next year's save-the-date

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// New: Event Gallery
- Users upload photos (must be authenticated)
- Tag vehicles in photos
- Link photo to car listing (if for sale)
- Social sharing

// New: Event Feedback
- "Were you there?" button
- Rate the event (1-5 stars)
- Review: parking, organization, variety
- "Would you attend again?"

// Analytics
- Track which events drive most site traffic
- Which events correlate with purchase inquiries
- Regional interest patterns
```

---

### 5B. Event-Driven Purchase Journey (Week 2)

#### 5. **"See It at a Show" Feature** 👁️ Priority: HIGH

**Concept:** Connect vehicles for sale with upcoming events

**On Vehicle Detail Page:**
```typescript
// New section: "See Similar Vehicles at Upcoming Shows"

Example:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🚗 See 1967 Mustangs at Upcoming Shows      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ May 11 - Metamora Car Show (IL)             │
│   Expected: 50+ Muscle Cars                 │
│   → Add to Itinerary                        │
│                                             │
│ Jun 15 - Chicago Classic Auto Show          │
│   Expected: 100+ Classic Cars               │
│   → Add to Itinerary                        │
│                                             │
│ Jul 4 - Route 66 Cruisin' Reunion          │
│   Expected: 200+ Muscle/Classic             │
│   → Add to Itinerary                        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Algorithm:**
1. Get vehicle: make, model, year, category
2. Find events in next 6 months
3. Filter by:
   - Event category matches vehicle (muscle show → muscle car)
   - Geographic proximity (within 300 miles of vehicle location)
   - Event size (larger events = more likely to see similar cars)
4. Sort by date (soonest first)

**Why This Works:**
- Reduces purchase anxiety → "I can see similar cars in person before buying"
- Drives event attendance → Cross-promotion
- Builds trust → "This platform helps me make informed decisions"

---
